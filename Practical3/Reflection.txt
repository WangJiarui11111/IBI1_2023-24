This is my reflection about the practical.
The practical taught me how to use VS code and github and how to create my own websites, it's really interesting and useful.
But I think it's also a little challenging, I need my classmates' help and teacher's guidance when I work on it.
Sometimes there may be some errors and conflicts, and I am not familiar with the VS code and github at the beginning.
But when I solve this problems, I feel like my ability was improved.
